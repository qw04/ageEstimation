					In this section, I will be talking about the limitations of the solution that I have implemented. The main one is the fact that my model, is a black box model, therefore, I have no clue regarding how the decision is made by the model. This means that my model could be using some of the biases of the images, I used to train my model with. Moreover, another drawback, is that my model attempts to predict age based on the face which displays the biological age of the person, not the chronological age (as laws are based on that) which I want to predict, while the chronological and biological age will have some similarities, my classification will be somewhat accurate, but not entirely accurate.

			<!-- like the first part of the body this also contains a filler image, and the lorem ipsum paragraphs just in the opposite way to make the website look nice -->
			<div class = "description">
				<p>
					Another problem with my model, is that accuracy is based from person to person and the predictions dont have an element of inherent randomness to them, therefore some people will always look older, and therefore be classified as being over even if they arenâ€™t, therefore taking more samples of their face might not help a lot. Here are the accuracies of both my models:
